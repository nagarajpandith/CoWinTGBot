Note that this project is a work by (avinaash)[https://github.com/avinassh/cowin-assist].
 This is a simple Telegram bot to Check slots availability

## Note

On 6th May 2021, CoWin API added caching and rate limits. The public API data would be cached upto 30 minutes, so the alerts wouldn't be so instant in busy areas, which reduced this bot's functionality to being a nice UI for public CoWin site in Telegram.

### System Requirements

This bot is built and tested on Linux and Mac OS X. It should work on Windows machines as well, but I haven't tested it. Other requirements:

- Python 3 (version 3.8+)
- SQLite 3
