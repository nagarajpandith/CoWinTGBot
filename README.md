[The bot is no more active as there's no such need for now. The bot was previously hosted on AWS, and temporarily hosted on Heroku later. But the bot couldn't access CoWin API as Heroku is not an India based server]

# Covid-19 Vaccine India Assist Telegram Bot

Extended from [avinassh/cowin-assist](https://github.com/avinassh/cowin-assist). Go check it out.

This is a simple Telegram bot to

- Check slots availability
- Get an alert when slots become available

## Note

On 6th May 2021, CoWin API added caching and rate limits. The public API data would be cached upto 30 minutes, so the alerts wouldn't be so instant in busy areas, which reduced this bot's functionality to being a nice UI for public CoWin site in Telegram.
